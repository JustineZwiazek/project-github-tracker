# GitHub Tracker

This week we are creating a GitHub tracker

Requirements:
â€¢ A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
â€¢ Your username and profile picture
â€¢ Most recent update (push) for each repo
â€¢ Name of your default branch for each repo
â€¢ URL to the actual GitHub repo
â€¢ Number of commits for each repo
â€¢ It should be responsive (mobile first)
â€¢ A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) using Chart.js.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
