# GitHub Tracker

This week we are creating a GitHub tracker

Requirements:
â€¢ A list of all repos that are forked from Technigo
â€¢ Your username and profile picture
â€¢ Most recent update (push) for each repo
â€¢ Name of your default branch for each repo
â€¢ URL to the actual GitHub repo
â€¢ Number of commits for each repo
â€¢ It should be responsive (mobile first)
â€¢ A visualisation, for example through a pie chart, of how many projects you've done so far, compared to how many you will do (in total it will be 19 weekly projects ðŸ¥³) using Chart.js.

## The problem

I stated by reviewing the GitHub documentation. Then looked at the instructions hos to use the dynamic id. The profile section was easy to get up, but then I struggled with getting commits up. I had an error in the dynamic id. Once I solved it I moved on to the chart. Getting the data up was not easy, it took me some time to understand how to pass on the info from script to the chart.
